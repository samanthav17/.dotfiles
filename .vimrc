As I went through this lab, I used the guided instructions and followed them as best as I could. I did everything smoothly and allowed to add contents to my text file, to have different colored words and numbers in my text file. This is super cool! After I added this, I ran into trouble copying the .vimrc file to my ~/Desktop directory in one command. At first I created a directory and  accidentally made 'sviscel_lab02_guided.txt' the directory, then nothing else was working. I figured out I had to create a file IN the ~/Desktop directory by using the touch command and then I successfully copied the contents of the .vimrc file into it.
